Since May 2025, I have been a research assistant to Dr. Mark Popinchalk, a post-doc at the American Museum of Natural History, as part of the AstroCom NYC program and in the Brown Dwarfs in New York City Group. The BDNYC Group is run by Dr. Jackie Faherty (AMNH) and Dr. Kelle Cruz (CUNY).

Over the summer, I compiled a catalog of Complex Rotator M Dwarf Stars from past papers and analyzed them with data from TESS, GAIA, and K2 to learn more about their characteristics and changes over time. We are targeting a paper submission in October 2025. All my code for the project can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/sarahedraves/SRMP-JMAG-Sarah).

I presented on this work in a 10 minute talk at the 2025 Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium at AMHH. The abstract for the presentation:  Complex rotators (CRs) are a recently discovered type of young M dwarf star that have unusual light curves, showing periodic behavior that cannot be explained by more typical causes like starspots. Previous studies have focused on identifying CRs and have suffered from a lack of observations over long temporal baselines. In this project, we compiled a data set of previously identified CRs in the literature and their available K2 and TESS light curves. Also using Gaia data, we investigate the similarities between these objects as well as how they change over time. In the multiyear timeframe we looked at (in some cases over a decade), we found CRs changed their complex patterns significantly or lost their complexity entirely. Further analysis of the light curves could yield better insights into the causes of these changes. This data set will be pivotal for others in the field to continue studying this unusual phenomenon.
