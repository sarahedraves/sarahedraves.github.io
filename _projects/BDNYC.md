description: Work with the BDNYC Group

Since May 2025, I have been a research assistant to Dr. Mark Popinchalk, a post-doc at the American Museum of Natural History, as part of the AstroCom NYC program and in the Brown Dwarfs in New York City Group. The BDNYC Group is run by Dr. Jackie Faherty (AMNH) and Dr. Kelle Cruz (CUNY).

Over the summer, I compiled a catalog of Complex Rotator M Dwarf Stars from past papers and analyzed them with data from TESS, GAIA, and K2 to learn more about their characteristics and changes over time. We are targeting a paper submission in October 2025. All my code for the project can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/sarahedraves/SRMP-JMAG-Sarah).
