Made this website today from a template on GitHub! It's from the same creator as the GitHub CV template that I used. Editing the CV taught me more about formatting in LaTex, since previously I'd only used LaTex for writing up lab reports or math assignments in classes and adding to documents that other people created in OverLeaf. I also learned some about how GitHub actions and pages work. That made creating this website simpler since I already knew the process. Keeping straight the syntax in the different md, html, and yml files is a bit complicated but it seems I've gotten most things working so far! Just need to add my research projects to that tab.

Perhaps I will update this in the future with progress on my research and in my career. We'll see!
