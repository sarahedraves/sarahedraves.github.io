I am an astrophysics researcher and physics undergraduate with a strong foundation in computational methods,
data analysis, and physics coursework. I'm experienced in working with large astronomical datasets with
various Python packages. I'm currently applying to physics and astronomy PhD programs with the goal of
continuing research in observational astrophysics.
